Michelle! What a surprise! How did you get so slim? You look so lively and fresh!
Really? Maybe it's from doing yoga the last two months. I feel so good now.
Oh, really? That's awesome. Should I take a course? Well… I'm doing archery right now.
Don't worry. You can do both sports at the same time. You can join the yoga class with me next Friday evening.
Sure. Why not?

Manchester United new boy Ashley Young scored the only goal of the game in the 35th minute.
England played well in the first half but in the second half Wales made life difficult for Fabio Capello's men as they kept testing them.
Substitute Robert Earnshaw missed a golden opportunity of equalizing as the Cardiff City striker hit the ball over the cross bar.
England is now very close to qualify for the finals.

I heard you and your colleagues have just come back from the tour in China. How was your trip?
Wonderful! I've never had such a good vacation like this before. The tour guide is friendly and we went sightseeing and shopping every night.
Wow, that sounds really fun. Was it a package holiday?
Yeah. We just wanted to relax so we booked this tour. We didn't need to worry about the hotel, meals, or any other things.
Good choice. Maybe I should go there this winter holiday. There're not many tourists at that time of the year, right?
No, there aren't.

How's the preparation? Did you pack the luggage?
Urr… I'm doing it. Urr… So many clothes to bring. The suitcase is too full already.
Honey, don't try to bring everything. Just bring what we need and we can buy some clothes there. And don't forget the camera and sunscreen. The sun on the beach is strong.
Ok, I know.
I need to go change some money now. Bye.
Bye.

Clare, this movie looks exciting. Let's watch it.
"Insidious"? That is a horror movie?
Yes, it is.
No, I can't stand this genre. Let's choose another one. Thriller or Western maybe. That would be interesting.
Ok.

Excuse me! Can you show me where I can get shampoo?
It's at the end of this supermarket, the cosmetics shelf.
Ah, thank you. And where can I get a basket or a trolley?
They are at the main gate, madam. Shall I take you there?
Thanks. You are so kind.
#7
Excuse me. May I try this on, please?
Shop assistant: Of course, madam.
Where's the changing room?
It's over there.
Thanks.
How is it, madam?
It doesn't suit me.
What size do you take?
I'm size S.
Sorry madam. We're out of that size. Would another one with a different design do?
I only like the one with this design. Sorry, I don't want anything else.
That's ok, madam.

Good afternoon, everyone.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Lockwood.
How are you today?
I'm fine, thank you.
Alright.
Now, let's begin today's lesson.
Today we will learn about science.
Open your book to page seven.
Anna, stand up and read the passage on page seven, please.

Pardon me! Could you show me the way to the airport, please?
Ok. You can go to the airport by bus or taxi. If you go by bus, the nearest bus stop is two km walking distance from here.
Oh God! What about taking a taxi?
It's nearer. The taxi stand is on Summer Street.
And how can we get there?
You go to the end of this street, turn right at the traffic light.
You go one block to the crossroads of Summer and Winter Street and see a roundabout.
There you turn left and you can see the taxi stand there.

Mary, want an icecream?
Yes, please. Oh my God! It is boiling hot today. And because it's humid, it feels hotter.
Yeah. The weather forecast says it will continue to be sunny for the next two weeks.
Gosh! I wish it would be rainy tomorrow
