A: "What are you doing tomorrow?"
B: "Nothing really."
A: "Let's watch a movie or something."
B: "What's on these days?"
A: "I think they're playing Lord of the Rings"
B: "That sounds pretty good. Let's watch that."
A: "Where should we meet?"
B: "How about at the subway entrance."
A: "Aright. I'll meet you there at one o'clock."
#2
A: "What should we do this Saturday?"
B: "Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday."
A: "Yeah, but I don't know if it is going to be any good."
B: "The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five."
A: "True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday."
B: "How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, and then go see the movie afterwards."
A: "Sounds like a plan. Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00."
#3
A: "What type of movies do you like?"
B: "I like all sorts of movies, primarily drama and science fiction."
A: "That's an interesting combination. How about western movies?"
B: "Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for."
A: "Why don't you like horror? They're entertaining."
B: "Some are entertaining, but I find most of them stupid and childish. For example, I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious."
A: "Ha ha. I know what you mean. But it's just a movie. They need for the characters to do that."
#4
A: "Hey, you wanna see a movie tomorrow?"
B: "Sounds like a good plan. What do you want to see?"
A: "How about Legally Blonde."
B: "Ah, my girlfriend wanted to see that movie. I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time. How about The Cube?"
A: "Isn't that a scary movie?"
B: "How scary can it be? Come on, it'll be fun."
A: "Ok. I'll give it a try."
B: "That's the spirit. I'll see you tomorrow after class."
A: "Ok. See you tomorrow."
#5
A: "Hey Jack. How were your classes this semester?"
B: "They were not too bad. I really liked my poli-sci class."
A: "Would you consider it your favorite class?"
B: "I don't know if I would call it my favorite, but it ranks up there."
A: "What class was your favorite then?"
B: "I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific."
A: "I never took that yet. If that was your favorite, I think I will check it out."
#6
A: "Hey Bob. Whatcha you doing?"
B: "I'm at home painting."
A: "I didn't know you paint. What type of painting is it?"
B: "I enjoy oil painting. I learned it in one of my extra classes in college."
A: "That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby."
B: "Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it."
A: "I think I will. Thanks for the info."
#7
A: "Hey Joanne. What are you up to?"
B: "I'm just watching some television."
A: "I'm so bored. I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning."
B: "Me too. Do you think we are boring people?"
A: "I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies."
B: "That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?"
A: "That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings."
B: "I like to play the piano for fun."
A: "Yeah. That can be a good hobby."
B: "Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do."
A: "That's a great idea. I'm going to do the same."
#8
A: "Hey Michael. Where are you going?"
B: "No where special. I was just taking a walk."
A: "What for?"
B: "To get a little exercise. I'm so out of shape."
A: "Hey, I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week. It's great exercise and it's fun too. Why don't you come out and play with us?"
B: "That sounds great. Give me a call next time you guys play."
#9
A: "All I do all day is work and watch TV. I really should start thinking about my health."
B: "I never thought about that, but you're right. What do you think we should do?"
A: "For starters, we should start doing more outdoor activities. That way we'll get some exercise."
B: "I was thinking about taking tennis lessons. I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon. What do you think about that?"
A: "That's not a bad idea. How much is it?"
B: "I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons."
A: "Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start. Count me in."
#10
A: "What do you do besides work and watching TV?"
