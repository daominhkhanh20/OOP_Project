Can you believe her? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet.
Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn't think about going on a diet.
Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight.
That's because you don't exercise. If you were more active, you wouldn't have a dieting problem."
What do you know? You are over weight too.
I'm not on a diet though
I know. But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, then I think we can lose some weight.
I like ice cream too much though.
C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.
It does sound appealing.
It's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed."
Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.
Great. I'll get our plan started right away.
Can we start tomorrow though?

You see that chick over there?
The one in the red shirt?
Yeah. Isn't she hot?
She's alright.
Just alright?!? She's hot!
Why don't you go talk to her?
You think she's out of my league?
Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all.
Come on. I get nervous when I talk to girls.
Why don't you go stand next to her for awhile and if an opportunity comes up, strike a conversation.
What do I talk about?
It doesn't matter. You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that.
I don't know...
Do you want me to go talk to her?
No. Stay away from her.
If you don't do anything, I'll bet somebody else will.
Ok already. I'll try.

Hey Jack. What's going on?
Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me?
Really? When did you decide this?
I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.
That's exciting man.
So how did you propose?
You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.
What do you think I should do?
There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.
I never thought about that.
Thought about what?
Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react?
I don't know. You should know how she's going to react. She is your girlfriend.
I think that's the idea I was looking for. Thanks man.
Don't mention it. Good luck. You're going to need it.

What sports do you like to play?
I like baseball and basketball.
How about football?
In my country football is brand new, so I never learned the game when I was younger.
It's a very popular game in America.
Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?
For me, it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.
Are you a football player?
No, just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.
What is two hand touch and flag football?
Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.
I see. It's safer then right?
Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us.
I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.
Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.
Great.

Hey Steve. When's the next time you're going to play golf?
I'm going out this Saturday.
Do you already have a foursome?
Unfortunately, we do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.
That sounds good. Where do you want to play?
We won't have much time, so let's play somewhere close to work.
How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.
How much does it cost over there?
Twilight rates are 21 dollars.
That's pretty good. Let's do it.
Aright. I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4:00.
Make it 4:15. I won't get off until 4:00.
Ok. I'll call you later when I get a tee time.
Sounds good. I'll see you on Wednesday then.
Aright. Have fun on Saturday.
Will do.

Hey Jackie. What are you doing?
Nothing much. I'm just relaxing today. Why? What's going on?
I was thinking about heading to the mall. Do you want to go?
Are they having a sale?
Yeah. Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale. It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on.
That sounds great. Where should we meet?
I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes.
Sounds good. See you there.
What do you think about these shoes?
They're cute. But do you think you'll wear them much?
No. Not really.
This sweater is so pretty. I love the low neck design.
I bet it's expensive.
It's on sale for $80. What do you think? Should I try them on?
For 80 bucks it looks great. Go try it on.

Where is your dressing room?
Right over there.
Person A comes out of the dressing room
How did you like the sweater?
I loved it. I'll take it.
Great. I can ring you up over here. It comes to $87.04.
Here you go?
Do you have a credit card with us?
No I don't.
If you open up a card, you can save 10% on all your purchases today.
Not today. Thanks though.
No problem. We always have this offer, so when ever you decide to, just let us know.
Sure.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yeah. I was looking at some of your pants, but they are all a bit too long. Do you have alteration services here?
Yes. It cost $7, and it takes one day.
Great. Thanks for your help.
Thank you, and have a great day.

I love your bracelet. When did you get it?
I got it awhile ago, but I haven't worn it much. You really like it?
Yeah. It's beautiful. Is it white gold or silver?
It's white gold.
Where did you buy it?
My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out.
That's so sweet. What was the occasion?
That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.
You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.
My birthday is coming up next month. We'll find out pretty soon.
What do you want?
I wouldn't mind a necklace. I was at the jewelry shop looking around, and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want.
Why not a ring?
I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet.
But you're ready for everything else?
Damn right.

What a beautiful watch. It goes very well with your ring.
Thank you.
Is that your wedding ring?
I'm not married yet. It's my engagement ring.
Well, congratulations. When is the big date?
In June.
Did you have the watch before getting the ring?
Actually, we bought the ring together after I got the watch.
You did a fabulous job with the selection. It's gorgeous.
Thank you so much.
What kind of watch is it?
It's a Tag Heuer.
If you don't mind me asking, how much do they cost?
This one is $1500. But they range from $600 to $3000.
That's why it looks so nice. I should have figured. You always get what you pay for.
Yeah. I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones.

Why are you so quiet?
My girlfriend just broke up with me.
You must feel terrible now.
Yeah.
I remember my first break up. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was crying everyday for three months. And slowly, it got better. I know you'll feel better too.
You've been through this too?
Yeah. I remember it very clearly. The pain makes it easy to remember. I know you're really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups.
But it hurts too much.
I know it's painful, but it's only temporary. After the pain goes away, you'll find other girls.
What if I don't want to find another girl?
You'll change your mind. Look at everyone in the world. They all break up and move on. The faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover.
You're right.
I also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. You know she didn't treat you that well. Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?
Yeah. Thanks for the talk.
I'll give you a call later. We should hang out. It's good to be around people.
Ok. I'll talk to you later.
